      2 - user puts a second finger on touchscreen (or touches the screen
          with his palm)
      3 - user keeps panning with his finger from step 1
      4 - user raises finger from step 1.
      5 - user moves finger/contact point from step 2
      6 - user puts another finger on touchscreen and starts panning

      Outcome: panning shouldn't be affected at all by the touch point from step 2.
      That touch point should be completely ignored.
